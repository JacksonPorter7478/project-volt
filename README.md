Thanks for taking the time to look at my project, any feedback is muchly appreciated!✨ </br>
Due to how Next.js backend functions, it does not natively support WebRTC. I used a third party library as workaround, but its very unstable. The server goes offline after a few calls to it have been made. At the moment the site mainly works only on the client. Currently working on migrating this project to react.
